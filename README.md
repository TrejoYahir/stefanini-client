# Stefanini Interview

This project was made using 
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
- [JSON server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
- [Faker](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/)
- [Lodash](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/)

## Live demo

You can find the **live demo** of the frontend client [here](https://stefanini-client.herokuapp.com/) and access the data from JSON-server [here](https://stefanini-backend.herokuapp.com/). 

## Running the server locally

If you want to run the server locally just clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/TrejoYahir/stefanini-client.git` and follow these steps:

- Go to the folder called `json-server` and in the terminal type `npm start` or `npm install` and then `node server.js`. 
This will generate random data and start the fake server. You can go to `localhost:3000` and see the generated data.
- Go back to the root folder, type `npm install` and then `ng serve --open` in the terminal. 
This will start the angular development client at `localhost:4200` and will open it in a new browser tab.

That's it. Now you can go explore the demo!
